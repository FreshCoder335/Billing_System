# Overview


This program is a simple billing system that can track shopping sessions, edit them, and delete them should that 
be neccessary. 

The purpose of this program I made is to simply practice and learn more about C++ as I have never used this lanuguage before.
Not only that, utalizing it in microsoft visual studio 2022 gave me exposure to a different coding environment 
that allowed me to experiement with different tactics at programming.
